# Formula One Hub — React + Vite

A React + Vite port of your provided HTML.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL printed in the terminal.

## Notes
- Images are set to royalty‑free Unsplash placeholders. Swap them in `src/App.jsx` and `src/styles.css`.
- The "engine rev" sound is a tiny WebAudio effect that only plays on user interaction and when the 🔊 toggle is ON.
- All behaviors (tilt, fade‑in, carousel wheel scroll, mobile menu) are implemented with React hooks.
